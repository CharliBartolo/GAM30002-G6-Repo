1. Checkpoints MUST NOT be children of other objects
2. PlayerPos.cs needs to be added to player object so prefab may/will need to be updated
3. GameMaster.cs needs player object's x,y,z position manually entered

Note: had problem getting temperature on the current player so i used the older player
