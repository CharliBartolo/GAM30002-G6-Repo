Instructions for set-up:
1. the scene running all scene parts will only need the bare minimum essentials(e.g. player, game master etc.)
2. Scenes need to be added to the build and also made into a prefab
3. when in the scene that is running all the scenes box collider must be added to 
each scene part prefab in the hierarchy(please use exact scene name) and for now ScenePartLoader.cs

Warnings:
- the box collider for scenes parts should not over lap one another otherwise one of the scenes
will continue to load and unload itself continuously 

Problems: 
- when player leaves a scene part(e.g. Scene3) the scene will refresh meaning 
it will as if it is the players first time going into that part
- when a scene part loads in it will appear in the exact same x,y,z loaction as in the orignal scene

Advice:
- when making the scene that is going to run all parts you may want to create 
the whole level there then use the box colliders the act as a measuring tool to see 
what each part will be loaded in togethet. you could then make multiple copies of this scene
and delete which parts aren't required for it

Furtue work for multi scene management:
- integrating ScenePartLoader.cs into checkpoints script
